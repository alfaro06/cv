        <p>Hello, my name is Luis Alfaro, I am 21 years old and on a journey to figure out who I am and what I want to accomplish in life. Life can be very hard and intimidating, however this should not stop us from achieving our goals. I've lived my
          life
          in fear for as long as I can remember. April 9th 2021 is the day that all changes. From this day forward I will work hard to achieve my dreams and goals of becoming happy within myself and becoming financially free. My main goal in life is
          to be
          happy and secure with myself, never doubting myself. I see life as a beautiful opportunity yet my inner thoughts make life difficult. I try to be as positive as I can be but there is always something. To my future self I love you and do not
          ever
          be afraid to be yourself and fail. Everything is going to be okay, you are a champion and a different person, you are not meant to be like everyone else. Embrace your differences and live the life you want. You only get one life, dont be
          afraid
          to fail, don't play it safe, take your opportunities. I love you. - Billionaire Luis Alfaro </p>
